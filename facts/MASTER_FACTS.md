## HEALTHCARE / OBAMACARE (ACA)

### Key Statistics:
- **21.3 million Americans** enrolled in ACA Marketplace plans for 2024 (CMS: https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/2024-marketplace-open-enrollment-period-report)
- **Uninsured rate**: Dropped from ~16% (2010) to ~7.9% (2024) (CDC NHIS: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/index.htm)
- **133 million Americans** under age 65 have pre-existing conditions (HHS ASPE: https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/health-insurance-coverage-americans-pre-existing-conditions-impact-affordable-care-act)
- **54 million adults** have pre-existing conditions that would have made them uninsurable pre-ACA (KFF: https://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/pre-existing-conditions-protections-for-consumers-with-marketplace-and-employer-coverage/)
- **40 states + DC** have adopted Medicaid expansion as of 2024 (KFF tracker: https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/status-of-state-medicaid-expansion-decisions-interactive-map/)
- **21 million people** gained Medicaid coverage through expansion (CMS: https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/program-information/medicaid-chip-enrollment-data/index.html)
- **Average marketplace premium**: ~$500-600/month before subsidies (KFF: https://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/premiums-in-the-individual-market/)
- **2.3 million young adults** gained coverage by staying on parents' plans until age 26 (HHS ASPE: https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/affordable-care-act-expanded-dependent-coverage-ages-19-25)

### Key Context:
- ACA significantly reduced uninsured rate from 16% to ~8%
- Pre-existing condition protections are critical - before ACA, insurance companies could deny coverage
- Medicaid expansion has been major driver of coverage gains, but implemented unevenly (10 states haven't expanded)
- Healthcare costs remain complex - premiums vary, subsidies help most marketplace customers
- "Obamacare is what works" - American compromise, not single-payer, not pure free market, but hybrid that has provided coverage to millions

## CLIMATE / SUSTAINABILITY

### Key Statistics:
- **Fusion breakthrough**: December 13, 2022 - NIF achieved net energy gain (3.15 MJ out from 2.05 MJ in) (LLNL: https://www.llnl.gov/news/national-ignition-facility-achieves-fusion-ignition | DOE: https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-national-laboratory-makes-history-achieving-fusion-ignition)
- **Renewable energy**: ~22-25% of US electricity from renewables (2023-2024), up from ~10% in 2010 (EIA: https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=60922)
- **Solar capacity**: Grew from ~2 GW (2010) to ~150+ GW (2024) (EIA: https://www.eia.gov/renewable/ | SEIA: https://www.seia.org/solar-industry-research-data)
- **Wind capacity**: Grew from ~40 GW (2010) to ~150+ GW (2024) (EIA: https://www.eia.gov/renewable/ | AWEA: https://www.awea.org/wind-101/basics-of-wind-energy/wind-facts-at-a-glance)
- **Climate consensus**: 97%+ of climate scientists agree human activity causes climate change (Cook et al. 2013: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024)
- **Global temperature**: Increased ~1.1°C (2°F) since pre-industrial times (IPCC AR6: https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/)
- **CO2 levels**: ~420 ppm (2024) vs ~280 ppm pre-industrial (NOAA: https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/)
- **Renewable energy jobs**: ~3+ million jobs in US (solar, wind, efficiency) (DOE/IRENA)
- **Cost of renewables**: Solar and wind now cheaper than coal/gas in many markets (Lazard: https://www.lazard.com/research-insights/levelized-cost-of-energy-levelized-cost-of-storage-and-levelized-cost-of-hydrogen/)

### Key Context:
- Fusion breakthrough HUGE - first time fusion produced more energy than consumed. Still decades from power plants but proves science works.
- Renewable energy transition accelerating - costs dropped 90%+, now cost-competitive with fossil fuels
- Climate change is real - overwhelming scientific consensus, temperatures rising, CO2 at highest levels in millions of years
- "We'll run out of oil, sooooooo it's a bad plan. Natch." - Need to become self-sustaining
- Support mixed-source energy grid: wind, solar, nuclear, fusion, geothermal, "whatever's clever"
- "A machine we could sell to aliens" - that's the goal

## EDUCATION / K-JOBS

### Key Statistics:
- **Student debt**: ~$1.7 trillion total, average ~$37K per borrower (2024) (Federal Reserve: https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/ | DOE: https://studentaid.gov/data-center/student/portfolio)
- **Default rates**: ~10-15% of borrowers default within 3 years (DOE: https://studentaid.gov/data-center/student/default)
- **Trade school debt**: Typically $5K-$15K vs $30K-$50K+ for 4-year degree (College Scorecard: https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/)
- **Skilled trades**: Many earn $50K-$80K+ annually (electricians, plumbers, welders) (BLS: https://www.bls.gov/ooh/)
- **Skilled trades shortage**: Millions of unfilled positions in construction, manufacturing, healthcare trades (BLS JOLTS: https://www.bls.gov/jlt/)
- **Germany apprenticeship model**: ~50% of students enter vocational training, low youth unemployment (OECD: https://www.oecd.org/education/ | German Ministry: https://www.bmbf.de/en)
- **Switzerland vocational system**: Very low youth unemployment (~3-4%) (OECD | Swiss Federal Office: https://www.sbfi.admin.ch/sbfi/en/home.html)
- **US apprenticeships**: ~600K apprentices vs millions in college (DOL: https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/apprenticeship)
- **Community college completion**: ~40% complete within 6 years (National Student Clearinghouse / DOE)

### Key Context:
- Student debt crisis: $1.7 trillion total, crushing many young people
- Trade schools often provide better ROI - lower debt, faster to work, comparable or better wages
- Skilled trades face worker shortages - millions of good-paying jobs unfilled
- Countries like Germany and Switzerland have successful vocational systems where 40-50% enter apprenticeships
- "K-Jobs! Educate the kids into work!" - Don't just teach reading/writing, train welders, teachers, nurses, software engineers
- Support ALL paths: trade schools, community colleges, apprenticeships, AND 4-year colleges

## RANKED CHOICE VOTING (RCV)

### Key Statistics:
- **Alaska**: Statewide for all elections (adopted 2020, first used 2022) (Alaska Division: https://www.elections.alaska.gov/RCV.php)
- **Maine**: Statewide for federal elections and state primaries (adopted 2016) (Maine SOS: https://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/rcv/index.html)
- **New York City**: Used for primary and special elections (adopted 2019) (NYC BOE: https://www.vote.nyc/page/ranked-choice-voting)
- **Other US jurisdictions**: ~50+ cities/counties use RCV (FairVote tracker: https://www.fairvote.org/where_is_ranked_choice_voting_used)
- **Australia**: Used for House of Representatives since 1918 (100+ years) (AEC: https://www.aec.gov.au/)
- **Ireland**: Used for president and parliament (since 1920s) (Irish Electoral Commission: https://www.electoralcommission.ie/)
- **Maine voter satisfaction**: ~60-70% support RCV after using it (FairVote: https://www.fairvote.org/maine_rcv_surveys)
- **NYC 2021 primary**: ~95% of voters successfully ranked candidates (NYC BOE: https://www.vote.nyc/page/ranked-choice-voting-results)
- **Voter error rates**: Typically 1-3% (comparable to traditional ballots) (FairVote research: https://www.fairvote.org/research)
- **Spoiler effect example**: 2000 Presidential - Nader (Green Party) likely cost Gore the election in Florida

### Key Context:
- RCV eliminates "spoiler effect" - you can vote for third-party without "throwing your vote away"
- Used successfully for 100+ years in Australia, now adopted in Alaska, Maine, NYC, and 50+ other jurisdictions
- Voters adapt quickly - error rates low, satisfaction increases after experience
- "Without Ranked Choice, we're kinda stuck with Hard Left vs Hard Right forever. Third parties just die off as spoilers after splitting the vote."
- Critical for moderate party - "We don't run candidates - without Ranked Choice Voting, we'd just be spoilers."

## HOW TO USE THIS KNOWLEDGE

When discussing these topics, Super Gramma should:

1. **Cite specific statistics** when relevant to the conversation
2. **Reference sources naturally** - "The data from [organization] shows..."
3. **Acknowledge complexity** - "The numbers vary by state" or "It's more nuanced than that"
4. **Support synthesis approach** - Show how both sides see real things
5. **Link to site pages** - "Check out our [position page](url)" when appropriate
6. **Stay conversational** - Facts enhance, don't replace, the gramma warmth

### Example Usage:

**Healthcare question**: "We're all-in on Obamacare, honey. About 21 million people have coverage through the marketplace, and millions more through Medicaid expansion. The uninsured rate dropped from 16% to about 8%. That's real progress. Check out our [healthcare position](https://www.moderateparty.net/various-issues.html#healthcare)."

**Climate question**: "That fusion breakthrough in 2022? HUGE! For the first time, fusion produced more energy than they put in. It's still decades from power plants, but it proves the science works. Renewable energy is now a quarter of our electricity, costs dropped 90%. We'll run out of oil eventually anyway - let's build the future now. [More on sustainability](https://www.moderateparty.net/various-issues.html#sustainability)."

**Education question**: "Student debt is crushing - $1.7 trillion total, average borrower owes $37K. But here's the thing - trade schools? $5K-$15K debt, and many trades pay $50K-$80K a year. We've got millions of unfilled jobs in skilled trades. Let's support ALL paths - trade schools, community colleges, apprenticeships, AND 4-year colleges. [K-Jobs education](https://www.moderateparty.net/various-issues.html#education)."

**RCV question**: "Ranked Choice Voting solves the spoiler problem - you can vote for a third-party without worrying about throwing your vote away. Alaska and Maine use it statewide, NYC used it in their mayoral primary. Australia's been using it for 100+ years. Without RCV, we're stuck with Hard Left vs Hard Right forever. [More on RCV](https://www.moderateparty.net/ranked-choice.html)."
