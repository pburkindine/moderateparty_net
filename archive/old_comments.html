      <h4>Opening Slogans/Comments</h4>
      <pre><!--span>The people had tried to run the world as a vs. each other type of thing, and it was working, nominally.  But they had not received good tools yet, and it was not very good.  I yelled something about it somewhat briefly before dying.</span-->

<p style="margin-top: 5px; ; font-size: 13px;"> -- I Obviously Will Now Just Agree with You About Absolutely Everything -- </p>

<!--span style="font-size: 13px">
(The creepiest job ever)<br/>
(I hate this page)</span--></pre>

      <h4>Political Commentary</h4>
      <pre><!-- </li><li style="font-size: 15px;">Or um...<br>
Now, don't get me wrong...</u> I like the people of [ <span style="text-transform: uppercase">random culture</span> ].  I really do; they're just plain nice folks.  But they're wrong about [<span style="text-transform: uppercase">xyz</span>], doggonit.<br><br> -->

<!-- But - and I've got to take a super-serious tone on this one - they're making a mistake as regards  [Issue #14-R].  There is more to say on that."</div><br><br> --></pre>

      <h4>First Amendment Section</h4>
      <pre><!-- <a name="first_amendment"></a>
<center><u>The First Amendment</u> - Freedom of the Mouth to Fail to Stop Talking :D
</center><br><br>
<!--If you don't like variety, I understand, but you are in the wrong country.  Freedom of speech guarantees all manner of variety that you are going to disagree with.  I don't know what to tell you other-wise.<br/><br/>

It's a free country. There's going to be people that don't belong to your religion, and don't care to.  There's going to be gays.  Whatever.  There's going to be one of everyone.<br><br>

They all want to be treated well, and you're the jerk if you can't bother.  Just get used to it, you know?<br><br> --></pre>

      <h4>Self-Healing Systems Section</h4>
      <pre><!--
<center><a href="#top" style="font-size: small;">Top</a></center><br><br><a name="onesided"></a><a name="selfcorrecting"></a>
<center><u>Self-Healing Systems</u><br/>
  (Be Critical of Your Own Stuff, Too)<br>
</center><br>

Take it all in, eh? Are you super conservative about enjoying cake?  An area to be as strict as you can?  Are you super liberal about your ability to fly?  Figure, hey, why not, I'll give it a whack? <br><br>

<!--I usually kind of put on a little play in my head, where all the different sides of the thing have actors playing them?<br/><br/>

We need a variety of eyes on it to get good stuff out of the machinery. <!-- It's <i>so</i> easy to avoid ever figuring out what the other fellow's point even is....<br><br>

<br>
<br><br> -->

<!--
<center><a href="#top" style="font-size: small;">Top</a></center><br><br><a name="younewb"></a><center><a name="stupid"></a></center>
<center><u>"Are you new here, pal?"</u></center><br>
This probably sounds hokey, but we're going to say it: calling people stupid is bad for the works.  There's no such thing as stupid.<br><br>

They're just new at this or that; they need something explained better.  Stop hating, start educating.<br><br><br> --></pre>

      <h4>Capitalism Commentary</h4>
      <pre><!-- <center><span style="font-size: 14px; text-decoration: underline;">These next few sections are about capitalism being mostly kind of awesome, and getting the safety net "just right."</span><br>You may want to open <a href="" target="_blank">an hateful e-mail</a> so you can yell at me as we go.</center><br><br> -->

<!-- We need laws and social programs and stuff.  Human rights are sort of why "government" exists.<br/><br/> -->

<!-- The Constitution favors this "limited-style" government, de-centralized government, sandbox government; that appeals to the engineer in me.<br/><br/> -->

<!-- But then, look at slavery!<br/><br/> --></pre>

      <h4>Healthcare Section</h4>
      <pre><!-- <center><u>Universal Healthcare</u></center><br>

So, yeah, pro-universal health care.  Single-payer style or keep your own.  Why? It's cheaper by a large margin because it cuts out a middle man (the insurer).  It has its problems, but across dozens of countries for decades, it works.<br/><br/>

And yeah, it's a rights issue, like clean water.  If you're working your whole life like most people, you shouldn't be one quick broken arm away from bankruptcy.<br><br> --></pre>

      <h4>Gun Rights Section</h4>

<!--center><a href="#top" style="font-size: small;">Top</a></center><br/><br/><a name="deathpenalty"></a>
<center><u>The Death Penalty</u></center><br/> Yes, for all murderers and pedophiles.  As a deterrant, not as revenge.  Like, with real sympathy, being that bad will only go away if it's that scary.  Like, this would be from some date in the future, i.e.<br/><br/>

Put this another way - if people knew that you would get the death penalty for killing someone while driving drunk, do you think people would keep driving drunk?  It's like how a guy won't hit you so he doesn't go to jail again.<br/><br/--></pre>

      <h4>Ayn Rand Commentary</h4>
      <pre><!-- <center><a href="#top" style="font-size: small;">Top</a></center><br><br><a name="aynrand"></a> -->
<!-- <a name="individualism"></a>
<center><u>Ayn Rand and The Dangers of Fiction</u></center><br><br>

Fiction is a bad way to do philosophy.  Everyone sides with the hero of the story.<br><br>

Ayn Rand is great on one side of the subject, but just that side.  Don't get me wrong, I like individualism. Dreams are good.<br><br>

Ayn Rand's work helped us find the flaw with Communism.  It's fine to want a big slice of the pie; a little bit of fancy for yourself, hey :D<br><br>

But, individualism isn't going to protect the community from an individual, and some guys are jerks, am I wrong.<br><br>

"We're doing a whole big <i>thing</i> here."  That's 'God's money,' it's for building the works. ;D<br><br>

We need super-man business leaders who are "hostly," who are in it to create jobs.<br><br>

The trickle down is <a href="#robots" target="_blank">broken because of the robots</a>.<br><br> --></pre>

      <h4>Drug Policy Commentary</h4>
      <pre><!--

<center><u>Doing a Bunch of Hard Drugs and Being a Piece of Crap and Stealing</u><br/>
Or, "Hey, Lampshade Larry?"<br/><br/></center>

Well, quit it!  Quit it, you drunk! You're frickin' ruining the party for everyone.  Grow up and get a job like unto yore!  You ain't my problem.  Sheesh.<br/><br/>

(On the other hand, just to be fair, where are all these jobs?  <a href="#robots" target="_blank">Age of the Robots</a>...)<br/><br/>
--></pre>

      <h4>Religion Commentary</h4>
      <pre><!-- Islam means 'peace,' and most Muslims are every day, hard-working, moral people.  Let's not let their Angry Young Men take their religion.<br><br> -->

<!-- As a <a href="http://www.surfchristian.net" target="_blank">Christian</a> sort of a guy, I hope the folks will learn "sales", "seed-tending." You just can't prove anything with violence.  It's an "own-goal."<br><br> -->

<!--
Put this another way, to both sides: if you have a plan that involves billions of people suddenly changing religions because their worst enemy is telling them to -- your plan is terrible.<br/><br/>
--></pre>

      <h4>Diversity Commentary</h4>
      <pre><!-- "Win-Win" - "Lookie, kids, unusual people!"<br><br> -->

<!-- If they like it, and they're not too demanding, hey.  "Ain't like I'm any better..."<br><br> -->

<!-- I mean, do your thing, you know?  I avoid, y'know, the roll-around-in-a-bag-of-rusty-nails-and-lemons crowd :P  Not everything is for everyone.<br><br> --></pre>

      <h4>Closing Comments</h4>
      <pre><!--NEWS TEAM!  ASSEMBLE! (Ron Burgundy and the gang, Anchorman)-->

<!-- <u>Some 'Closing Thoughts' Type of Thing...</u><br><br> -->

<!-- We're just people.  We're the mere Earthlings that get this planet - l / -->

<!-- Let's just 'leave it all' sort of, turn the thing into a real shin-dig. We all wound up here together, and I'm sure everyone wants a seat.  Me included!<br><br> -->

<!-- Let's not let people keep treating all us moderates and independents as non-players with nothing to say.  We say plenty!  I say we stand up for ourselves, say this is not for us.  Get a little riled up, get our own thing going. -->
