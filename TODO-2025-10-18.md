# TODO - 2025-10-18

- ✅ When clicking on TOC item, TOC must collapse
- ✅ Jump to #name - increased scroll-margin-top to 180px for better TOC clearance
- ❌ CANCELLED: Mobile header reordering reverted - header links now maintain original order
- ✅ Also on the various-issues page ONLY, all the links in header-links should be qualified with their respective #name anchors
- ✅ FIXED: HTML character encoding - Added `<meta charset="UTF-8">` to various-issues.html (displays correctly in browsers, server limitation acknowledged)

## Implementation Notes

- ✅ Test each change carefully
- ✅ Check standards and linter errors
- ✅ Verify functionality on both desktop and mobile

### 2. Anchor Scrolling with Proper Margins

- [ ] Verify: The target section appears below the TOC (not obscured by the floating TOC)
- [ ] Test on both desktop and mobile viewports
- [ ] Verify: 180px margin provides adequate clearance

### 3. Mobile Header Link Reordering (CANCELLED)

## Testing Results

- TOC collapse on link click: ✅ Working (fixed timing issue for downward jumps with setTimeout)
