 <u>Q</u>: <i>I loathe your opinion!  You're personally to blame for every bad thing that ever happened, and should tear off your own arm and beat yourself to death with it.<br><br>

We hate you and you're terrible; you have offensive personal odor and an onion-loving mother.</i>
<br><br> <u>A</u>: Thank you!  I'll be here all night, ladies and germs!  Tip your waitress.

<u>Q</u>: <i>"Ain't nothin' in the middle of the road but yellow stripes and dead armadillos."</i><br><br>
<u>A</u>: That's one thing.  What about a sandwich or a pencil, know what I mean?<br>
	<br>Or like how some things have inedible centers, like a peach, and some have
	edible centers only, like a push-freeze.

<br><br><!--Or you know how air is free?  Like, to breathe?-->

<br><br>This isn't some new perfect thing, either.  There's gonna be a "too moderate" just like there's a "too liberal" or "too conservative".<br/><br/>

The obvious thing is not to be too centrist; you have to take sides, and mean it. We just, y'know, need a minute to think about it.<br/><br/>

<!-- he obvious bit is centrism; both sides have an opinion, but they don't always both have a point or a moral leg to stand on. -->

<!-- The obvious one is centrism, and we're adamant that a lot of issues land hard on one side and centrism is the wrong approach.<br/><br/> -->


<!-- We're always thinking about being "too moderate", but <a href="http://www.themiddleparty.net/site2/index.php/mmi-stuff/contact" target="_blank">contact us</a>, shoot...<br><br> -->


<!-- <br><br><br><br> -->
<br> <br/><u>Q</u>: <i>This stuff is too long.  Can't you make it shorter?  I don't have time to read all your stuff, guy.</i>
<br><br/> <u>A</u>: "I didn't have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead." - Mark Twain

<u>Q</u>: <i>What's your goal here?</i><br><br>
<u>A</u>: To come within a hundred miles of it.  I think like golf. Get the sucker in the hole eventually.  "Just tap it in, just tap it in! Give it a little tappy!  Tap-tap, tap-a-roo!"<br><br>

The thing is, we needed something. For folks who aren't just conservative or liberal.  More to raise our kids up in, because we didn't have the option.  Didn't want to <i>be</i> a liberal or a conservative.  <a href="real-v-fake.html" target="_blank">If it goes further, hey</a>.<br><br> -->

<!-- I'm <b>terrified</b> of my own ego and temper, and yours, too.  I found this thing-a-ma-bob, and I'm trying to do it some justice.<br><br> -->

<br><br></center>
<hr width="20%"><br>
<br> -->


<!--<u>Q</u>: <i>Well, then, you should change it to my opinion about this or that!  Tyrant!</i><br><br>

<u>A</u>: I know, I know.<br><br>

I'm being a jerk to keep it from derailing into a shouting match about who's the most moderate-est, if that's okay. I <a href="mailto:" target="_blank">will learn</a> from anybody; I think people have <a href="complementary.html">complementary</a> perspectives.  I'm doing my best to "find that sweet spot," and I pray about it all the time.  Fair?<br><br>

Anyways, I'm hoping you're going to gloss over my massive ego and focus on the good stuff.

<!-- <u>Q</u>: <i>Doesn't it just raise a bunch of questions?</i><br><br>
<u>A</u>: No, you get used to it. Questions don't take like forever and ever. You get familiar and all.  It's like a balance board?<br><br> -->

<!-- <center>

You grow up, you get a job, you do right by someone, maybe a couple rug-rats, have fun on the weekend...<br><br>

Gravity is down; it's not like it's up... the world is the world, it's not like this stuff is going away.<br><br>

So, you balance the budget, you protect freedoms, make the world "a wonder to God..." roads and waterworks, you keep the population/job numbers stable, keep the water and air clean and the temperature set at 72 degrees... United we stand!<br <br=""><br> -->
