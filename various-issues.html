          Capitalism is what works, but it only works when it's in check. Like, some people are jerks.<br /><br />


          But it has all the coolest stuff, this capitalis-mo. Free society, great products at low low prices, a
          productive life working for <u>The Enormously Large Company Whom We All Love So Dearly</u><br><br>





          Communism failed, capitalism fails without feeling it all the time. Look in between, see what is like [police,
          fire, school, army, health] service and what is just business.<br /><br />

          The Constitution favors this "limited-style" government, de-centralized government, sandbox government; that appeals to the engineer in me.<br/><br/>

          I think of taxes as the admission fee to an amusement park. If you don't like the prices, or the way they're

          <center><u>The Size of the Government</u></center><br> Gigantic. Just gigantic, way huge. A personal
          assistant/super-cop for every man, woman and child. Just one guy, namely you, has to work 20 hours a day while
          everyone else laughs at you.<br><br>

          No, tiny, total anarchy. The powerful using the weak as serfs; armed robbery in the open streets.<br><br>

          No, somewhere in between. Whatever works.  The Constitution favors a limited-"style" government.  <a href="#obamacare">Which are the service tiles?</a><br><br>

          U.S. currency today is "fiat," it has no collateral. Fiat currency and a central bank and bottomless inflation
          go hand in hand, even to the fall of a nation over its worthless dollar. So, people into economics will insist
          that the gold standard is important. #EndTheFed<br /><br />

          Here's former congressman Ron Paul:

          <center><u>Pro-Obamacare</u></center><br />

          So, for-profit healthcare is never going to be there for the working poor.  People who work their whole lives don't deserve to live in fear.<br/><br/>

          And state healthcare, despite eliminating a middleman, is known for long wait times, etc.<br/><br/>

          Neither idea is getting anywhere, and instead we
          now have Obamacare. It's been the law for a decade, and it doesn't seem to have sunk the insurers or ruined
          anything. Seems like it's given folks at the bottom some peace of mind by offering them some emergency
          insurance. So we're going all-in, Obamacare is what works in real life.<br /><br />

          Yeah - 100%! Educate the kids into work, don't just teach them to read and then complain about welfare. Train a
          welder or a teacher or a nurse, train a software engineer.<br/><br/>

          The kids want to succeed!  And making sure they can is our one main job, I'd say.<br /><br />

          It's like how there will always be drunk driving deaths, but we don't ban alcohol? It's very sad, but it's

          We support, you know, background checks, metal detectors, school cops, waiting periods, mental health screening. Like, guns are dangerous.
          Whatever works, whatever helps.  Maybe those fingerprint things?<br><br>

          While we're in the neighborhood... Folks should also recognize (if they haven't) that the arms industry has a

          Abortion is a tough topic.  We've been overwhelmed, crushed, haunted by the arguments from both sides for many years.  <!--Rape, medical necessity, dismemberment abortion, it's all enough to scream.-->  Perhaps state's rights is the best we can do for now.<br/><br/>

          There is no perfect solution here, and not much room for a compromise.<br /><br />

          After years of trying to work this out, it occurred to us... this may sound wacky, but what about pre-natal
          incubation as an option? "Very early adoption?"  Like as a charity thing?<br><br>

          Sure, it won't solve everything, would make a terrible government program.  And maybe it sounds silly at first.  But it's another option, yeah?<br/><br/>
