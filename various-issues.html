          It's my stuff, and my family, and I'm apt to have a gun to protect it. "If you outlaw guns, only guns will
          have guns..." Wait, that's not

          already against the law.<br><br>

          We support, you know, background checks and waiting periods and fun stuff like that. Like, guns are dangerous.
          Whatever's clever. Maybe those fingerprint things?<br><br>

          While we're in the neighborhood... Folks should also recognize (if they haven't) that the arms industry has a

      Put this another way - if people knew that you would get the death penalty for killing someone while driving drunk, do you think people would keep driving drunk?  It's like how a guy won't hit you so he doesn't go to jail again.<br/><br/-->

      Fiction is a bad way to do philosophy.  Everyone sides with the hero of the story.<br><br>

      Ayn Rand is great on one side of the subject, but just that side.  Don't get me wrong, I like individualism. Dreams are good.<br><br>

      Ayn Rand's work helped us find the flaw with Communism.  It's fine to want a big slice of the pie; a little bit of fancy for yourself, hey :D<br><br>

      But, individualism isn't going to protect the community from an individual, and some guys are jerks, am I wrong.<br><br>

          <center>Abortion - <u>What about Pre-Natal Incubation?</u></center><br>

          Abortion is a tough topic. We're sensitive to the arguments made by both sides and believe abortion should be
          "safe, legal, and rarer and rarer."<br /><br />

          There is no perfect solution here, and not much room for a compromise.<br /><br />

          After years of trying to work this out, it occurred to us... this may sound wacky, but what about pre-natal
          incubation as an option? "Very early adoption?"<br><br>

          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_uterus" target="_blank">Here's an article about the
            technology.</a> Dr. Yoshinori Kubawara of Japan has had great early success.<br><br>

          Where this conversation goes next is, what about the additional burden on our already-overburdened and deeply
          flawed foster care system? Who will watch these kids?<br /><br />

          So one thing is, we can majorly fix foster care. With money. Take money out of the perpetual war
          budget.<br /><br />

          <!-- But it will still be an issue.  Maybe charities could emerge, maybe the pre-natal incubation companies would limit you.  Nothing's perfect.  But we still like this answer a lot more than any we've heard.<br/><br/> -->

          We also strongly favor free birth control available at any age, and in general the rights of both parties.
