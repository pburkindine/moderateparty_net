          "We need job creators, not <i>ah</i> belly-ache-ers." &nbsp;:D&nbsp;<br><br>


          (Or, "You mean to tell me that this robot-ical man can sit there and make my money instead of me all day and
          night?! And I'll be off on my boots again at age 45, and a wife and teens? Well, finally!")<br><br>

          The trickle-down is broken because of the robots.  <pre>Profits > Jobs > Spending > Profits</pre> only works if <pre>Profits > Jobs</pre>, not <pre>Profits > Robots > Profits</pre>.  It's an unsustainable attitude toward society building.<br><br>


          <b>Robots can ultimately do just about anything, including <i>your</i> job, friend !!!</b> So where are we headed here?<br /><br />


          Robots don't <em>need</em> jobs, you know? That's "ash cash," as they say. Let's turn 'em off. Some of them.
          Anything you don't need a robot for, you know?<br><br>


          <!-- Let's measure wealth in cubicles instead of billions.<br><br> -->

          Look, I made a delightful graph:<br><br />

          We're going to have to decide to start turning some of them off to keep society working.<br /><br />
