            Abortion is a heartbreaking and impossible topic.  We've been overwhelmed, crushed, haunted
            by the arguments and stories from both sides for many years.  We don't want to add to the trouble.  There's no easy answer.  It's sad.<br/><br/>

            <!--Rape, medical necessity, dismemberment abortion, it's all enough to scream.-->
            Perhaps state's rights is the best we can do.  We believe technology and medicine will make this problem smaller in time.  We try to dream of a day when this issue is history.  <a target="_blank" href="https://nextnature.org/en/magazine/story/2017/1996-extrauterine-fetal-incubation">Prenatal incubation</a>, first developed by Dr. Y. Kubawara in 1996, may one day serve as an alternative.<br/><br/>

            <!-- We hope for technology to step in and help us solve this, someday.<br /><br /> -->

            <!-- There is no perfect solution here, and not much room for a
            compromise.<br /><br />

            After years of trying to work this out, it occurred to us... this
            may sound wacky, but what about pre-natal incubation as an option?
            "Very early adoption?" Like as a charity thing?<br /><br />

            Sure, it won't solve everything, would make a terrible government
            program. And maybe it sounds silly at first. But it's another
            option, yeah?<br /><br />
